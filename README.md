# HRFaultNet
High-resolution automatic fault identification method. This is a repository for the paper "What can deep learning-based resolution-improved seismic data do? A case study of faults identification".

## Workflow
An end-to-end workflow for automatic high-resolution fault identification. The original seismic image (a) is fed to the well-trained HRNet to acquire the high-resolution seismic image (b). Then, the well-trained FaultNet obtains the high-resolution fault identification results (c) from the enhanced seismic image.

## Example
Fault identification comparison on the Kerry3D seismic survey. (a) Raw seismic image. Fault probability maps (b), (c), and (d) are obtained by feeding (a) directly into FaultNet, FaultSeg3D, and Swin UNETR. (e) Seismic image is generated by HRNet with enhanced resolution and suppressed random noise. (f) High-resolution fault probability map obtained by feeding (e) into FaultNet. Fault annotations of the raw seismic image (g) and the HRNet-enhanced seismic image (h) are made by three interpreters (The red, blue, and green lines indicate the fault lines labeled by different interpreters.). The red arrows in (a) and (e) indicate two adjacent, closely spaced faults, and the yellow arrows indicate faults with small throws.
